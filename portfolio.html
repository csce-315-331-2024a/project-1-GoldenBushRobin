                <h4 class="section-title">Six Eyes</h4>
                <p class="section-text">Six Eyes is an image and video lookup based on an image search, searching through a database of videos, documents, and images, in order to enable more efficient relevant resource retrieval. For this project, I specifically work on both the back-end and the front to back connections, enabling http endpoints and connections between front end and back end. I built scripts to scrape the files off the internet and initiate connections with the database, a self-hosted redis server. This project was created for the <a href="https://x.tamuhack.org/">TAMUhack X</a> in January.

                <h4 class="section-title">SketchID</h4>
                <p class="section-text">SketchID is a sketch identifier created for the <a href="https://tamudatathon.com/challenges/docs/PictionaryPlunge">2023 Datathon Pictionary Plunge challenge.</a>As the provided training dataset for this challenge was significantly small, I employed techniques like transfer learning to transfer knowledge from a larger dataset with more classifications, then fine tuned to the given classifications. In addition, as the problem involved identifying sketches, I used a recurrent neural network(RNN), a bi-directional neural network to imploy Long short-term memory(LSTM). This convolution neural network won first place for this competition.

                <p class="section-text">Graphite is a note taking web application that contains features like topic connection graphs and markdown and latex enabled editor. I specifically worked on the back end, and some shown features, enabling the topic graph seen on the left, as well as enabling the custom linking to other topics. This project was made for the <a href="https://tamuhack.org/th/2023">2023 tamuhack</a> competition in spring. My team won second place overall with this project.
